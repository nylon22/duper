# @duper/pause-auto-follow

> Pause an auto-follow pattern. When this command runs, the auto-follow pattern is inactive and ignores any new index created on the remote cluster that matches any of the auto-followâ€™s patterns. Paused auto-follow patterns appear with the active field set to false in the get-auto-follow command.

> You can resume auto-following with the resume-auto-follow command. Once resumed, the auto-follow pattern is active again and automatically configures follower indices for newly created indices on the remote cluster that match its patterns. Remote indices created while the pattern was paused will also be followed, unless they have been deleted or closed in the meantime.

## Usage

```sh
$ duper pause-auto-follow [options]
```
