# @duper/resume-auto-follow

> Resume an auto-follow pattern on your follower cluster that has been paused with the pause-auto-follow command. When this command runs, the auto-follow pattern will resume configuring following indices for newly created indices on your leader cluster that match its patterns. Indices created on your leader cluster that match the auto-follow pattern while the pattern was paused will also be followed, unless they have been deleted or closed in the meantime.
