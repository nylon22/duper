> The command line tool that simplifes administering Elasticsearch Cross-cluster Replication

## Why duper

Cross-datacenter replication of Elasticsearch clusters is a necessity for fault-tolerant production systems. Elasticsearch's Cross Cluster Replication (CCR) API satisfies this need. Elasticsearch provides a UI to administer CCR via its Kibana offering. So why use duper? If you prefer the command line, `duper` is the tool for you.

For more on CCR, check out the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ccr-apis.html)
